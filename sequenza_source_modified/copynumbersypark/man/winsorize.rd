\title{Winsorization of copy number data}
\description{
  Outliers in copy number data are detected and modified using MAD or PCF Winsorization.
}
\usage{
winsorize(data, pos.unit = "bp", arms = NULL, method = "mad", tau = 2.5, 
          k = 25, gamma = 40, iter = 1, assembly = "hg19", digits = 4, 
          return.outliers = FALSE, save.res = FALSE, file.names = NULL, 
          verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{either a data frame or the name of a tab-separated file from which copy number data can be read. The rows of the data frame or file should represent the probes. Column 1 must hold numeric or character chromosome numbers, column 2 the numeric local probe positions, and subsequent column(s) the numeric copy number measurements for one or more samples. The header of copy number columns should give sample IDs.}
  \item{pos.unit}{the unit used to represent the probe positions. Allowed options are "mbp" (mega base pairs), "kbp" (kilo base pairs) or "bp" (base pairs). By default assumed to be "bp".}
  \item{arms}{optional character vector containing chromosome arms (denoted 'p' and 'q') corresponding to the chromosomes and positions found in \code{data}. If not specified chromosome arms are found using the built-in genome assembly version determined by \code{assembly}.}
  \item{method}{the Winsorization method to be applied, must be one of "mad" (default) or "pcf".}
  \item{tau}{Winsorization threshold, default is 2.5.}
  \item{k}{the half window size to be applied in median filtering, default is 25.}
  \item{gamma}{penalty for each discontinuity in the pcf curve, default is 40. Only applicable when \code{method="pcf"}.}
  \item{iter}{number of iterations in PCF Winsorization, default is 1.}
  \item{assembly}{a string specifying which genome assembly version should be applied to determine chromosome arms. Allowed options are "hg19", "hg18", "hg17" and "hg16" (corresponding to the four latest human genome annotations in the UCSC genome browser).}
  \item{digits}{the number of decimals to be applied when reporting results. Default is 4.}
  \item{return.outliers}{logical value indicating whether a data frame identifying outliers should be returned, default is FALSE.}
  \item{save.res}{logical value indicating whether results should be saved in text files, default is FALSE.}
  \item{file.names}{optional character vector of length two giving the name of the files where the Winsorized data and outlier statuses, respectively, should be saved if \code{save.res=TRUE}.}
  \item{verbose}{logical value indicating whether or not to print a progress message each time Winsorization is finished for a new chromosome arm.}
}
\details{The copy number data are either MAD Winsorized or PCF Winsorized as described in Nilsen and Liestoel et al. (2012). Winsorization is done separately on each chromosome arm in each sample.}

\value{
   If \code{return.outliers = TRUE} a list with the following components:
   \item{wins.data}{a data frame with chromosome numbers in the first column, probe positions in the second and the Winsorized copy number values for the sample(s) in subsequent column(s).}
   \item{wins.outliers}{a data frame with chromosome numbers in the first column, probe positions in the second and outlier statuses for each sample in the subsequent column(s). The values +/- 1 indicate that the observation is an outlier, whereas the value 0 indicates that it is not.}
   If \code{return.outliers = FALSE} only the data frame containing the winsorized data is returned.

   If \code{save.res=TRUE} the results are saved in text files with names as specified in \code{file.names}. If \code{file.names=NULL}, a folder named "Wins_res" is created in the working directory and Winsorized data and outlier statuses are saved in this directory in tab-separated files named wins.data.txt and wins.outliers.txt, respectively.

\note{
Any missing values in \code{data} imply that the Winsorized value and outlier status for this probe will be missing as well. Also, if the number of probes within a chromosome arm is less than 2*k, Winsorization cannot be done and the data values are thus left unchanged.

\examples{
#Lymphoma data
data(lymphoma)
#Take out a smaller subset of 3 samples (using subsetData):
sub.lymphoma <- subsetData(lymphoma,sample=1:3)

#Do MAD Winsorization:
wins.data <- winsorize(data=sub.lymphoma)
